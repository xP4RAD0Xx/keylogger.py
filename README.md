# Keylogger.py
- A basic Keylogger implementation using python for windows. The script uses the C Types and Win32 API calls to hook and handle keyboard events and convert the inputs to ascii and display to the user.
- The scipt also checks for the foreground process to identigy which application the user is using, and provides the result in the output.
